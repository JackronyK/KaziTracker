Question 1 (10 marks)

You receive a dataset used to report monthly insurance claims. During your analysis, you notice missing values and duplicated records.

a) What steps would you take before producing any report?
b) How would you communicate the issue to management

a. Data Cleaning
Before  producing any report I would performing data cleaning to  ensure the monthly report capture the state of claims as  it is. 
-> For the missing values I would filter out to understand the extend of the null values for the saif column or rows. 
-> If a values like the policy number is missing, I would ask the owner of the data to  check and re-quiry the data. For values like the claims and it happens it is a insurance claim from  the same class of insurance I would impute like fill using the mean of similar class of insurance. 
->  For rows that  have so many missing rows like the policy number the claim amount, date I would exclude from  my monthly  report 
-> For the duplicate I would remove them especially after satisfying, it was a duplicate obviously with collaboration with the data owner
b. In the data cleaning, I would take note of all the changes made i.e the data duplicate data removed, imputation done all the chenge and clarly communicate with the management that the analyse made such assumptions and chencges 


Question 2 (10 marks)

Two departments are using different definitions of “active policyholder,” resulting in conflicting reports.

How would you resolve this issue and prevent it from happening again?

To resolve this I would engage  both  department to  make align the definitions of active policy holder and ensure they are all reading from  the same page.
To ensure these doesn't happen again in cansultion with all stateholder we would have a centralised  catalogue with definitions of key  words and terms to ensure everyone in the company we are quided by the same document for alignment and uniformity.

q3
Senior management requests a dashboard urgently, but the data pipeline is not fully validated.

What decision would you make, and why?

✍️ (Max ~120 words)

First thing is to communicate to them  that the dashbord woudl be delivered but it might sligly delay as we validate the data pipeline. 
-> THne I would focus first to  validate the pipeline before doing the dashbord to ensure I deliver a correct dashborad in  teh shortest time possible but this would happen ater the pipeline is validate  since wrong data would result to  wrong insight and later misinformed decisions which might result to  losses


Question 4 (10 marks)

Explain how you would design a Power BI dashboard for monitoring:

Policy acquisition

Claims ratio

Revenue performance

Focus on data model, KPIs, and usability


-> Understanding the terms from the business  side perspective

   ->  data on claims payment 
   -> Targets

-> After gathering the data then  load the dato Power BI 
-> Clean it incase of duplicate, missing values, outiliers and all that
->  Do several measure like total premum received, number of policies sold, total claims received, Profit, Profit MArgin
->  Design a classic dashbord with visuals to comminicate the KPIs and the metrics 
-> Prepare report breaking down the measure and derive insight in siimple terms understable to  the UserActivation
-> TO ensure usability I would docomunet the steps used and ensure I adhere to  the company sla

You are given a large dataset with customer, policy, and claims information.

a) What type of data model would you use and why?
b) How would this improve performance and analysis?

For  Large dataset aand to improve perfromance and analysis I would use direct Query. Assuming the data is in  realation database,,  I would quesry teh data ath t ais needed for that analysis.
Alos I would enrue my report has only the needed and most importance visual avoid cluttering teh dashbordd wit h so mnay pages and visual thta do not hold any weight to the final reportError


SECTION C: BUSINESS & ANALYTICS THINKING (Answer ONE)
Question 6 (10 marks)

Claims costs have increased by 18% in the last quarter.

Describe how you would analyze this issue and present insights to management.

To best  commicate this I would do a Root cause analysse try to understance what lead to  that increase. 
 - Was it from regulation changes?
 ->  Did  the governemnt increase the taxes?
 ->  As a compnay had we forseen  and factored in  such indrease in our revenue forcasting 
 
- After getting a clear picture of the root cause,
I would simplify it in best terms understable to  the end user  
- Also I would do aanalysi of what now to  expect in  the comming quatere and also the impact this increasre will have in  the final revunue 
- I would produce measure to  enrue in  teh futrue we factor this in expeciay by the actuarial teams to enure the company books are not so  much affected by such chaneg in  teh furtue
